            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IN the publication of this Treatiſe, I rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an higher Faith of Acceptance than <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi> or <hi>antiquity,</hi> though both of them are conſiderable perſuaſives, and are found in the Authour; who being diſtanced from us by a great interſpace of time and place, it being above 900 Years ſince he wrote: and he being now firſt brought to light out of the Miſt of a <hi>Syriack</hi> Manuſcript into our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, affords many things obſervable, worthy to be Tranſcrib'd into the Table-book of thy memory, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as well to poſitive Points, as to Scholaſtical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions in Theology.

<pb facs="tcp:105278:4"/>thoſe Controverſies as fully, as clearly, and with as much indifferency, as if they had been referred <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> to his Umpirage; and undoubtedly if moſt Controverſies between them were referred to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and genuine Expoſitions of diſintereſted Oriental Antiquity, eſpecially to the unſuſpected Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of <hi>Syriack</hi> Authours, as well thoſe Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which gave occaſion to Proteſtant and Roman Catholicks to part one from the other, as thoſe others which have grown up in the progreſs of Separation, might eaſily be reduced to ſuch terms of Agreement, as to make them mutually interrogate each other, (as <hi>Tiberius</hi> did his Souldiers) <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>What do we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for?</hi> It is certainly true, That we may rely upon the unſuſpected Teſtimonie of the Holy <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, who have been the great Aſſertors and Patrons of Truth; yet the exuberancy of their Stile (many times) overflowing in Rhetorical and florid elocution of Metaphors, Allegories, and Hyperboles, have made their expreſſions lyable to various ſenſes, which as they were ſeverally apprehended by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Readers, gave occaſion for divers Opinions, which may be beſt reconcil'd by reading of <hi>Syriack</hi> Fathers, who expound Scripture in the plaineſt terms without affectation of Stile, or flouriſhes of Oratory, and were not too much affected with litigious ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (the late incumbrances of Chriſtian Religion) and have not deriv'd their Doctrine from the ſource of any extremity of Opinion, but uſually give ſuch a ſenſe of the Ancients, as may give ſatisfaction to the indifferent of both parties, whereof I ſhall hereafter give many Inſtances, over and above what are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in this Treatiſe, in my Notes upon the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, the reſt of whoſe Works I am now Tranſlating
<pb facs="tcp:105278:5"/>into <hi>Latin,</hi> for the ſatisfaction and more general advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all thoſe, who by the advice of reaſon, are willing to ſurrender themſelves to the determination of ſincere Antiquity, and are not ſwayable in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the dictates of Intereſt, nor conducted by reaſons of State to the determination of their Profeſſion; for it is to no purpoſe, nor of much import, to endeavour the reconciliation of thoſe, who proportion the zeal which they have for Religion, by the weights of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of State, or refined products of Policy.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing in this Treatiſe, which favours the Saints of the Phanatick Calendar, nor oppugneth the Catholick Religion; but it may be allow'd without any great ſtreſs, in the Principles either of Roman Catholociſm, or Engliſh Proteſtancy, and may eaſily be eſpouſed to thoſe, who are not precontracted to prejudices and prepoſſeſſions of Education. It will be cenſur'd perhaps by the Schiſmatical pride of thoſe, who can never read ancient Authours with that indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie, which is requiſite to frame a right judgment of them; for how can they affect ancient Expoſitors, who are reſolv'd to follow their own ſenſe, and to ſtand to no judgement but their own.</p>
                  <p>This Authour <hi>Dionyſius Syrus,</hi> is of an authentick reputation, being a repleniſhed Treaſury of Chriſtian Doctrine, affording Rules of Faith to meaſure thy perſuaſion, and of conſcience, to govern thy actions: and though the Language wherein he wrote, hitherto interdicted him all communication with thoſe of our Horizon; yet it is the ſame which our Saviour Chriſt honoured with his own lips, whileſt he perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the World, and is in my eſteem one of the faithfulleſt Repoſitories, not onely of ancient ſecrets, but alſo of the moſt uncorrupted Truths.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:105278:5"/>
                  <p>That which may recommend him farther to thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, is the brevitie of his Expoſition; for if that Coyn be moſt to be prized, which is of greateſt value in the ſmaller pieces, then certainly a Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary on Holy Writ, which comprehends moſt matter in fewer words, doth deſerve moſt commendation.</p>
                  <p>The whole Contexture of the Authour, ſeems to be the reſult of mature and concocted thoughts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wandring <hi>Riveries</hi> of a rambling Phantaſie, or the affectation of frivolous ſubtilties.</p>
                  <p>His Stile ſavours rather of a ſtudied plainneſs, than a negligent rudeneſs, his Interpretations being ſo clear &amp; chryſtalline, as that thou mayeſt thereby diſcern the true meaning of the Text, without torture to thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: &amp; it is not my intention to furbiſh up an old Authour, ſo long hidden under the rubbiſh of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, with the brightneſs of a new ſtile; for nothing ſits more forward in my inclination, than to ſpeak the ſenſe of the Authour plainly, without ſetting thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Byaſs of affection, or intermixing it with the muddie immerſions of intereſt: and if the plainneſs of my language be a fault, I had rather confeſs it than deny it; for my intentions are free from all other ends, than a clear Repreſentation of the Authour, abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all intereſts and relative conſiderations, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to adjuſt my words by a true Tranſlation to the Authour's meaning, and thereby render a ſincere teſtimonie to Truth, and do right to my Authour, without omiſſion of intire clauſes, or the alteration of ſingle words; for Tranſlations of Books are like Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, where an Alteration is worſe than an Omiſſion.</p>
                  <p>True it is, That to Tranſlate is but a painful office under another man; Yet I am not of their opinion, who think that an exact conformitie to the words of
<pb facs="tcp:105278:6"/>another is too great a token of ſlaverie, but do eſteem it the honour of a Tranſlator: for as it is my cuſtom to ſpeak ſincerely and boldly, according to the dictates of my underſtanding: ſo in Tranſlating, I eſteem it my duty to rehearſe the perfect ſenſe of my Authour in its native ſinceritie: For, a Tranſlator ought not to imitate the Painters of Angels, who rather intend beauty than ſimilitude, and regard more the Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of a fair imagination, than the aſpect and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Truth; nor ought he to transfer the plain words of an Authour into the aires of humane ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, for he hath not the liberty to deſign a new Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but to draw a new Copy; and therefore exceſſes, which argue skill in a Poet, do convince a Tranſlator, as well as a Painter, of ignorance; or that which is worſe, and do not agree with the Function of a ſincere Tranſlator.</p>
                  <p>The variety of the Authour in this and the reſt of his Works, are ſufficient to lead the Reader into a large field of Contemplation; for, Obſervations are not here found, like ſo many Daizes, in a bare Common, here and there one; but in ſuch abundance as may ſerve to ſatisfie the appetite of a curious Reader with profitable inſtructions; and were it not for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of profitable Truths, I ſhould not think it worth the labour of a ſerious man, to ſtudy the Oriental Languages: For, to Tranſlate out of one Language in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, uſeleſs or common notions, were no better an imployment, than what Priors, Prefects, and Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of Convents impoſe on their Subjects <hi>(viz.)</hi> to ſcrape pebbles, and to fill bottomleſs veſſels.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Dionyſius Syrus</hi> was neither the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> nor <hi>Dionyſius exiguus,</hi> ſo famous for the computation of the Chriſtian <hi>Aera,</hi> nor <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus;</hi> for, the
<pb facs="tcp:105278:6"/>Authours whom he quotes, bring him ſo low down in the ſeries of Time, that he could not have been ſo much as a Contemporary with any of them, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt and the laſt nam'd. For, <hi>Dionyſius Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> was contemporary with St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who liv'd about the middle of the Third Century; and our <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius</hi> cites St. <hi>Severus,</hi> who lived about the Year 649.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, That he flouriſhed before 1058. of the <hi>Grecian</hi> account, which was not that, whereby either the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> or the <hi>Armenians</hi> meaſure their Calculation of time; For, the <hi>Aera Copti,</hi> which is commonly tearm'd the <hi>Diocletian,</hi> is counted <hi>ab eo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore quo Copton, celebrem urbem, Diocletianus ſolo aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit:</hi> And therefore according to a rectified collation of time, falleth ſhort of our account 280 Years; for, the Fifth of their <hi>Aera</hi> was the 285 of ours: And the computation of the <hi>Armenian Aera,</hi> falls ſhort of our computation of the number of Years from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Birth, 551 Years; but the <hi>Grecian</hi> account falls ſhort of ours about 310 or 320 Years: So that this Treatiſe of our <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> being Dated the Year 1058 of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> it follows by the ſubduction of 310 Years out of 1058, that he flouriſhed before the Year 784. For, in this Volume, wherein is contain'd his Expoſition of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and the other Three Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, he mentioneth ſeveral Treatiſes written by him, <hi>(viz.)</hi> his Expoſition on the Old Teſtament, and on the Epiſtles of the New, and ſeveral other Treatiſes, as you may ſee in his Expoſition on <hi>Matthew</hi> 27, and <hi>Mark</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>This Authour is conſiderable in himſelf, as alſo in regard of thoſe ancient Authours he quotes, as well <hi>Grecian</hi> as <hi>Syrian</hi> Fathers and Doctors. I ſhall not need
<pb facs="tcp:105278:7"/>to ſay any thing concerning the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, whoſe authority is conſpicuous enough; yet it will not be amiſs to ſpeak a word of ſome of thoſe <hi>Syriack</hi> Fathers and Doctors, of whom he makes moſt uſe of in his Works, ſuch as is <hi>Ephraim Syrus, Moſes Bar.

                     <p>BLeſſed <hi>Mark</hi> was he, of whom it is written in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, <hi>John, who was ſirnamed Mark:</hi> It was he, who once adhered unto <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when they Preached unto the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> He was of the Colledge of the Seventy two, and a Diſciple of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> He wrote his Goſpel in the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue at <hi>Rome,</hi> he wrote it briefly; not but that he had enough to have written at large, but that he had two Reaſons to contract himſelf. Firſt, He knew that the <hi>Romans</hi> were deſirous to have received the Goſpel from St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> The ſecond Reaſon was, That he might imitate his Maſter St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who wrote his Epiſtles conciſely, in few and apt words; for the <hi>Romans</hi> beſought St. <hi>Peter,</hi> That he would deliver in Writing the Goſpel which he had Preached by word of mouth concerning thoſe things which our Lord had done; and he gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand unto <hi>Mark</hi> his Diſciple, to commit the ſame to Writing, and the occaſion of the Narrative was thus:</p>
                     <p>Becauſe <hi>Shimeon</hi> had detected <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer in <hi>Samaria,</hi> he betook himſelf by flight unto <hi>Rome</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Claudius Caeſar;</hi> and by means of Sorcerie, and ſome appearances of Fancy which he preſented, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came famous amongſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> inſomuch, that they erected an Image for him, as if he had been a God, on the brink of the River which is called <hi>Tyber</hi> (becauſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105278:14"/>King <hi>Tyberinus</hi> was drowned therein) and another for his Curtezan, whoſe name was <hi>Sahelina,</hi> and in former times had been a common Strumpet in <hi>Tyre.</hi> When <hi>Shimeon</hi> had heard of this Seduction, he went to <hi>Rome</hi> to detect <hi>Simon;</hi> on a certain day, <hi>Simon</hi> by his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie made ſhew of raiſing a dead man, which was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by deluſion of the fancy; but <hi>Peter</hi> reſtored him to life in very deed, in the Name of Chriſt. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> then ſeeing the matter to be thus, roſe up againſt <hi>Simon,</hi> with intention to ſtone him: Whereupon, he being enraged with anger, ſaid unto them, Since that you have not approved of me, I will go to my Father who is in Heaven; and by his Sorcery made ſhew, as if a fiery Chariot had ſnatched him up aloft: And after he had mounted higher than all the ſublime Buildings of <hi>Rome, Peter</hi> then took courage, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted the Devils, who bore him up, and made the ſign of the Croſs in their ſight, and immediately they forſook him, and fled, and he fell on the earth, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which being obſerved by the <hi>Romans,</hi> they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God, and ſtraightway gathered up a heap of ſtones againſt <hi>Simon:</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> inſtructed them, and built a Church, which he governed for a long time; and when the <hi>Romans</hi> underſtood that <hi>Peter</hi> was diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to depart thence, and to Preach the Goſpel elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, they uſed perſuaſions to him, That he ſhould write a Goſpel for them; which he did not do, for two Reaſons: Firſt, Becauſe he could not attend it; for he was the prime Preacher, and deſired to Preach unto the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Secondly, Leſt the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhould forſake the other three Goſpels, and adhere to his onely, as being the Chief and Primate of all the reſt. Moreover, He did not hold himſelf worthy to write a Goſpel, becauſe of his denial, and therefore he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105278:14"/>perſuaded <hi>Mark,</hi> and he wrote; and whatſoever he delivered by word of mouth, his Diſciple wrote; and becauſe <hi>Matthew</hi> had ſpoken of the Genealogy of Chriſt, and his Generation, according to the Fleſh, he took his beginning from his Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>Others ſpeak of another occaſion: <hi>Tatianus</hi> a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Juſtinus</hi> the Philoſopher and Martyr, made a Collection out of the Four Evangeliſts, and thereof made and compoſed a Goſpel, and called it a <hi>Diateſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> that is of harmonies; and it was this Book which Prince <hi>Ephraim</hi> expounded, it begins thus, <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the Word. Clemens Romanus</hi> wrote in his great Epiſtle againſt thoſe who contemned Marriage; for that married men being ordained Apoſtles, they obſerved Chaſtity after they were made Diſciples: as alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> and others, who after they were thought worthy of Divine Revelations, abſtained from the Marriage bed: Saith <hi>Clemens,</hi> Do they alſo deſpiſe the Apoſtles? for <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> begate children, and <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf made no ſcruple to ſalute <hi>the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his marriage in an Epiſtle;</hi> but he did not lead her about with him, by reaſon of the modeſty of his Miniſtry. Whereas it is written in the <hi>Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> That after <hi>Peter</hi> was freed from Priſon by an Angel, he came to the houſe of <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>John,</hi> who was ſirnamed <hi>Mark;</hi> it is ſaid, that this <hi>Mary</hi> was the wife of <hi>Shimeon,</hi> and that <hi>Mark</hi> was his Son, and that the young Maiden <hi>Roda,</hi> who opened unto him, was his Daughter; and <hi>Peter</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her in his <hi>firſt Epiſtle</hi> which he wrote from <hi>Rome,</hi> deſcribing her under a figure, whil'ſt he calls her <hi>Babel,</hi> by reaſon of her excellency and renown; <hi>The choſen Church which is in Babel ſaluteth you, and Mark my ſon. Peter,</hi> after he was delivered out of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105278:15"/>Priſon, went to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and in the ſame Year built a Church there, and gave command to worſhip towards the Eaſt; and taught, that on the firſt day of the Week our Lord proceeded from his Mothers womb, and on the ſame day was the Reſurrection: And after two Years, he heard of the error of <hi>Simon,</hi> and placed <hi>Evodius</hi> Biſhop in <hi>Antioch,</hi> as his Succeſſor, and this Biſhop governed Twenty five Years; but <hi>Peter</hi> went up to <hi>Rome,</hi> by occaſion of <hi>Simon:</hi> This <hi>Simon</hi> was by Nation a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> of the Town called <hi>Gathnin;</hi> he was named <hi>Shimeon,</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> changed his name, and called him <hi>Simon.</hi> And when <hi>Peter</hi> entred into <hi>Rome,</hi> he found a Dog at the gate of <hi>Simons</hi> houſe, and ſaid unto him, Go in, ſignifie unto <hi>Simon</hi> that <hi>Shimeon</hi> is come to the gate. Again, <hi>Simon</hi> ſpoke in the Ear of an Oxe, and it was parted in two; but <hi>Peter</hi> revived it. Moreover, ſome of his followers deſired him to work ſome ſign in the fight of <hi>Shimeon,</hi> and it ſo fell out, that they met with a certain dead man, the ſon of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prianus,</hi> one of the Magiſtrates of the City, and <hi>Simon</hi> approached the Bier whereon he was carried, and ſpoke many things aloud, and with a low voyce, but the dead man was not raiſed; yet <hi>Peter</hi> immediately drew nigh, and cryed with a loud voyce, and ſaid in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt who hath been crucified, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the Bier; and with theſe words, the dead man was reſtored to life: Whereupon, the <hi>Romans</hi> roſe up to ſtone <hi>Simon;</hi> and when he made ſhew as if he were aſcending into Heaven, <hi>Peter</hi> rebuked the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and they forſook him, ſo that he fell down and dyed, as we ſaid in the firſt occaſion. And when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had governed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the ſpace of Twenty five Years, <hi>Nero</hi> commanded that he ſhould be crucified with his Head downwards; he eſtabliſhed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105278:15"/>Biſhop in his place <hi>Elius,</hi> whom the Apoſtle mentioneth in his <hi>ſecond Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Timothy;</hi> and after him, ſucceeded <hi>Clemens</hi> for Nine Years: And near the time that <hi>Peter</hi> was to be crucified, the <hi>Romans</hi> urged him by many perſuaſions, That he would write a Goſpel unto them; but he did not incline to their perſuaſion, leſt that the Goſpel of <hi>Matthew</hi> being already written, it ſhould be thought it had been diſpleaſing to <hi>Peter,</hi> had he written another, but he perſuaded <hi>Mark</hi> to write unto them the deeds of our Lord, his Objections and Replies; whereof he omitted many, and chiefly took care with much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to write thoſe things which concerned <hi>Peters</hi> denial, and it is poſſible, that <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf excited his diligence in that particular; and becauſe <hi>Simon</hi> had Preached there, that our Lord had not aſſumed a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he therefore took care to write of ſuch things as concerned his Humanity: And after <hi>Mark</hi> wrote a Goſpel in <hi>Rome,</hi> he immediately went to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and Preached there, and Eſtabliſhed a Church in <hi>Alexandria, Mark</hi> therefore is ſetled in a SEE. We are further to know, That there were Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts of the Twelve, and of the Seventy and two, according to the number of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts; but after the Apoſtles departed this life, their Diſciples carefully examined them, and choſe out of them four Goſpels, which the Church retained, becauſe they obſerved them to be agreeable and true; and finally, becauſe they were willing to prohibit men from uſing multiplicity of Books: becauſe they agreed in the ſame mind, they ordered the Apoſtles to begin and end, as the top and foundation; the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts they placed in the middle, to the intent they might honour the Seventy and two. They took Two Evangeliſts out of the Twelve, and Two out of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105278:16"/>Seventy and two: Others ſay, that this Inquiſition, or Examination, was made in the dayes of the Apoſtles, and that they choſe two Goſpels of their own, and two of the Seventy and two, which they ordained to be read in the Church.</p>

                        <hi>MARK, Chap. I.</hi> The Beginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
                     <p>THE beginning of the Goſpel was <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> Moreover, <hi>Baſilius</hi> and <hi>Philoxenus</hi> ſay thus, That St. <hi>Mark</hi> firſt uſed the word <hi>Evangelium,</hi> or Goſpel; and that Baptiſm was the beginning of the Goſpel. Others ſay, That the beginning of the <hi>Evangelium,</hi> which is good Tydings, is the Baptiſm of Chriſt, as bleſſed <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith; and inaſmuch as he ſaith, <hi>The Beginning of the Goſpel,</hi> he ſheweth, that he was the firſt that gave the name of <hi>Evangelium</hi> to a Book. Moreover, foraſmuch as <hi>Evangelium,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is by interpretation good Tydings, and Chriſt, before his Baptiſm, did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preach nor Evangelize; but after he was Baptized and Tempted, he immediately Preached, <hi>Repent, the Kingdom is at hand,</hi> as <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Moreover, from his Birth to his Baptiſm, he was governed by the Law, and from his Baptiſm by ſuch a new Adminiſtration as comported with the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Again, before his Baptiſm, he performed no Miracle, nor delivered any Doctrine, otherwiſe than by Queſtion and Anſwer in the Temple, when he was Twelve years old, as <hi>Luke</hi> ſayes. Moreover, thoſe things which were from his Birth to his Baptiſm, are not to be reputed as of the Goſpel, though they have relation thereunto, and are compiled therewith, that we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105278:17"/>might be taught after what manner were his Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Birth: Nor were it poſſible that we ſhould be capable of receiving the Doctrine of the Goſpel, if we had not firſt learned where and how he was born; whereas in thoſe Years, from his Birth, to his being Thirty Years of Age, he ſatisfied the Obligation of the Law of Nature, and the written Law; then he applied himſelf to frame a Module of a new World in his Baptiſm, and to Preach the Goſpel of the Kingdom of God. And foraſmuch as <hi>Mark</hi> knew that Baptiſm was <hi>the Beginning of the Goſpel,</hi> and that our Lord thence took his Commencement in the new Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, he wrote in the beginning of his Book thus, <hi>The Beginning of the Goſpel.</hi> And if it ſhall be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, Wherefore did the other Evangeliſts begin higher than his Baptiſm? It is plain that <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote ſo, that he might make it appear unto the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> to whom he wrote, That as the Prophets had before written, that Chriſt ſhould ſpring from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage of <hi>David,</hi> ſo he did then ſpring thence; and <hi>Luke,</hi> that he might bring them into Contempt who unskilfully undertook to write the Hiſtories of deeds, and <hi>John,</hi> that he might write concerning the Divinity of Chriſt, for that the other three omitted it, leſt it ſhould be concealed, and Chriſt be reputed but a meer man; for theſe three cauſes, they took their riſe ſo high, and not for that his Conception, his Birth, his Circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were of the Goſpel.</p>

                        <hi>The Son of God.</hi> He calls Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and not the Son of Grace, as ſay the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> for we are the ſons of grace; and that <hi>Mark</hi> doth not here call Jeſus Chriſt the Son of Grace, but the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Son of God, is evident from that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaid to the <hi>Philippians</hi> in an Epiſtle, <hi>Let this mind
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105278:17"/>be in your ſelves which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the likeneſs, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but evacuated himſelf of reputation, and aſſumed the likeneſs of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of the ſons of men, and in faſhion was found as man, and humbled himſelf, and became obedient even to death, even the death of the Croſs; wherefore God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly exalted him, and given him a Name more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than all names, That at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould how,</hi> &amp;c. Let the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and <hi>Calcedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> be demanded, Who is he who ſo evacuated himſelf, and aſſumed the likeneſs of a ſervant, Man, or the word God? Divine Nature, or Nature Humane? for Man and Humane Nature, were already evacuated, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, wherefore this is the ſenſe of the words, that the word God evacuated himſelf; and obſerve, that the word God, who evacuated himſelf, and aſſumed the likeneſs of a ſervant, doth he call Jeſus Chriſt, and to him is attributed Subjection, Obedience, and Death, and the Croſs, and to him is attributed Exaltation, and the giving of the Name of God, which is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than all Names. And foraſmuch as the Apoſtle ſaid concerning the <hi>word God,</hi> that he evacuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, theſe are evident Demonſtrations,</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That being equal in Nature with the Holy Ghoſt and Giver thereof, and having a natural Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he took upon him to be anointed and ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt as he was Man; for being made Man, he ſuffered natural and animal Paſſions, but not culpable; Hunger and Thirſt, Sleep and Death, did he taſte for us: And,</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105278:18"/>he might give us the Spirit to anoint and ſanctifie us, for that this word was anointed and ſanctified by the Spirit, becauſe he was ſent into the World, and was made man, is manifeſt from that which he ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Say ye of him whom the Father hath ſanctified, and ſent into the world, thou blaſphemeſt? becauſe I ſaid unto you that I am the Son of God;</hi> for it is certain, that he who was ſent from God the Father into the world, was <hi>God the word;</hi> and he who was ſent, was ſanctified by the Spirit; that the word <hi>God</hi> is called Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was made man, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>But to us there is one God, the Father of whom (are) all things; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom (are) all things; and one Holy Ghoſt, in whom (are) all things.</hi> Moreover, he ſaith of Chriſt, that all things were made by his hands, by whoſe hands therefore ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> that all things were created, whether by the hands of the Son of man, who was begotten of <hi>Mary,</hi> or by the hands of the word God, as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>All things were made by him;</hi> and the ſame word, <hi>by whom all things have been created,</hi> doth <hi>Paul</hi> call <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is evident therefore from theſe premiſes, that <hi>Mark</hi> calls the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son of God the Father, who was incarnated, and made man, by the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not the Son of man, who was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> who was the Son of Grace, as ſay the Hereticks:</p>

By the Girdle about his Loyns, and the Band upon his Bowels, he denotes the ſenſitive and intellectual Faculties, and Continency from an exorbitant Appetite, which in Proſperity is exuberant. By the winged Locuſts, the ſeed of the Juſt to meet the Lord. By the ſweetneſs of Honey, the ſweetneſs of the Bleſſings which come from our Lord, of higher value than Jewels.

                        <hi>The way ſide.</hi> He calls the obdurate Soul, which is not perfectly taken with the fear of God.</p>

                        <hi>To you it is given to know the Myſtery.</hi> That is to ſay, The Goſpel which was hid in Times paſt, and by which hath been revealed the Reſurrection and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, which he calls the Kingdom of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So is the Kingdom of God: As a man who caſteth ſeed on the ground.</hi> He calls Earth, the Souls and Hearts of the Faithful, wherein he ſowes the Goſpel, as alſo his Diſciples after him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And ſleepeth, and riſeth in the night.</hi> Night and day, he calls the time of his Aſcenſion, and laſt manifeſtation of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the ſeed increaſeth and groweth.</hi> That is to ſay, The Goſpel is magnified, and flouriſheth. And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That he doth not ſay that they do make it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iſe, but that the Seed riſeth; thereby ſhewing, that it is not by conſtraint, but by the power that is placed in us, that vertuous diſpoſitions do ſpring up in us as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105278:23"/>Seeds which increaſe and ſhoot up. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is of our own Will, that evil diſpoſitions do ſpring up in us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He knowing not how.</hi> It is not ſaid of himſelf, that he did not know; <hi>For he is the wiſdom of the Father, as the Father knew him, ſo he knew the Father, according to what he ſaid.</hi> If therefore he knew the Father, as the Father, as the Father knew him, how could he but know the Seeds growing and increaſing? He ſpeaks therefore after the manner of Plow-men, for they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once caſt the Seed into the ground, they take no more pains about it, for it ſprings up and increaſeth: So we have it in the power of our own Will to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in vertue. Do ye alſo ſowe, and teach all men, and do not trouble your Thoughts about the increaſe, more than the Plovv-man doth; for it is God that brings the Seed to perfection. Again, This of his <hi>knowing not,</hi> is thus to be underſtood, That the Seed, vvithout his further labour, arrives at perfection, by Divine povver and operation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Earth produceth fruit of her ſelf.</hi> As if a man ſhould ſay, I have ſovved the Seed of the Goſpel in mens Souls, and it aſcends unto Heaven; it is of Men, and of the power which is in them, that the fruits of Vertue may bud forth by this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt the blade, then the ear, and afterwards the full Corn.</hi> So alſo, Men firſt receive the Preaching of the Goſpel, and afterwards exerciſe Vertues, and at laſt are promoted by their Vertue, to the higheſt pitch of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and arrive to the ſtature of the perfect. And it is thus ſaid, becauſe they do not all in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der riſe in perfection, but firſt of all thoſe few who are ſubject to the Goſpel, and then by degrees many, who
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105278:23"/>all are to come to ſuch perfection, as that they may yield the fruits of Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And immediately he brings the Sickle.</hi> Even as when the Corn is full ripe, it is reaped and gathered into Barns; ſo alſo, Men when they arrive at the higheſt pitch of Vertue, they are to be exalted above the Heavens, and to be Careſſed with the delicacies in the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As a grain of muſtard-ſeed.</hi> He ſpeaks concerning the plenty and abundance which is to follow Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So that the Fowl might lodge under the ſhade thereof.</hi> Some Men raſhly ſay, That the Devils are here called Fowl, as having need to be hidden under the ſhade of the Goſpel; and do not take notice, that the Devils are reſerved to Darkneſs and Torment, and not to be hidden under the ſhade of the Goſpel. Others ſay, That the Angels are here called Fowl. Others, That Kings and Princes are called Fowl.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And there was a great Whirlewind.</hi> It is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, That his own Veſſel onely was toſſed with the Waves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Winds, and the Waves, fell upon the Ship.</hi> That he did not awake with all this Tempeſt, was an effect of his Divine Providence.</p>

Others, A Thouſand onely; but the firſt is thought the true Computation: But however it be, this ſheweth, That they were many; for this nature is ſubtile, and is not incumbred with a body; neither doth heat take place in them, as in bodies; for they who are Tempted of Devils, have leſs ſtrength than they, and this is ordered by the Providence of God; otherwayes, one Devil would deſtroy all Mankind. And it hath been ſaid, That the Devils do for the moſt part reſide in the Wilderneſs, and that ſome of them are permitted to be amongſt Men, for Tryal of their Liberty, and that the power of God might be made known in them. Some Men do prevaricate, and ſay, That there is not any Providence over Things that are viſible, for that Ten thouſand Devils have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over one Man: Againſt whom we can reply, for a general Providence is here manifeſt in this, That one Man is preſerved from the Tyranny of Ten thouſand Tyrants and Potentates, whereas one of them were able to deſtroy Thouſands, and Ten thouſands, if he had permiſſion from God.</p>

                     <p>The firſt wherewith they waſhed, that is to ſay, wherewith they cleanſed their bodies by reaſon of Nocturnal pollution, and of the touching of dead Carcaſſes, and ſo forth.</p>

                     <p>The fourth was this, when they invited any of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and men of Note, they waſhed with Water in honour of them, the Beds and Chairs, and veſſels of Braſs, and whatſoever veſſels they uſed in the ſervice, all theſe our Saviour abrogated, he ſpake here alſo concerning the waſhing of hands.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, That he might not be thought to have affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glory.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That he might convince thoſe who had ſeen the Miracle which he had done, and yet caſt Calumnies on Faith in him, that he ſighed even for them.</p>

And in putting his fingers into his ears, he ſignified, That it was he who created the Senſes, and eſtabliſhed the Members of Children in the Womb. <hi>My Father, ſaith he, worketh until now, and I alſo work.</hi> In three Things Chriſt delayed the Cure of this deaf man, <hi>In that he led him aſide: In that he put his fingers into his ears:</hi> and <hi>In that he did ſpit, and touch his tongue;</hi> for he was able to have granted him Health in a moment: For if the <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be in the twinkling of an eye?</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he might with more eaſe have wrought the Cure of one man, but he delayed it for three Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>The firſt was, That the deaf man might perceive that his Cure was not wrought all at once, but by little and little.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, That he might confirm his being made Man, and that the Myſtery of his Diſpenſation might not be thought a phantaſie, as the <hi>Phanaticks</hi> ſay; for this cauſe <hi>Mark</hi> was the more careful in this matter, that he might eradicate from the perſuaſion of the <hi>Romans</hi> the doctrines of <hi>Simon,</hi> for he ſaid that his Diſpenſation was in fancy. Moreover, He touched the Ears and Tongue of the dumb man, leſt the <hi>Jewes</hi> might ſay, That he nicely avoided the afflicted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105278:27"/>and that therefore he did not touch them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And he looked up to heaven.</hi> He looked up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that he might aſcribe to his Father what he had done, and that he might convince thoſe who ſaid he was an enemy to God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And he ſighed.</hi> Firſt, by reaſon of the hardneſs of their hearts, who ſaw the Miracles which he wrought, and did not believe. Secondly, becauſe there were ſome amongſt them, who did not onely not believe when they ſaw the Miracles which he did, but alſo crucified him. Thirdly, as a Shepherd, who ſighs for his loſt ſheep; and as a Mariner, for his ſhip that is loſt. Fourthly, by reaſon of Humane Nature, which until then, was humbled, afflicted, and brought into ſubjection. Fifthly, by reaſon of the captivity of our nature by the Devils.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And looking up to heaven, he ſaid unto him Ephphatha.</hi> He did not open him by prayer or ſupplication; but as <hi>in the beginning, he commanded the light, and it was made:</hi> And if any one ſay, That in the Beginning the Father commanded the Creatures that they ſhould be made; We anſwer, That there was the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, as it is written, <hi>That by the word of the Lord the heavens were made.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And ſtraightway his ears were opened.</hi> This was the operation of God, who, ſo ſoon as he commands any thing, it is perfectly done, according to that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and they were, and he commanded, and he aroſe; wherefore from hence, That he commanded, and it was done, we underſtand, That Chriſt, who is God, was made man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And he charged them, that they ſhould tell no man thereof.</hi> For he abſtained from vain glory, nay rather,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105278:28"/>he Taught how to ſhun it, and this which he ſaid: <hi>And he charged them,</hi> being of the plural number, whereas there was but one deaf man which he Cured, muſt be taken in this ſenſe, That he joined this deaf man with others whom he had Cured; or he charged this deaf man, together with the multitude there aſſembled, <hi>That they ſhould tell no man.</hi>

He calls Converſation a Sacrifice, and by Salt he means the <hi>grace of the Holy Ghoſt which ye have received, that it may be unto you an earneſt of thoſe things which are to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others ſay, That he ſpeaks unto them by way of Admonition, that together with the Faith they ſhould take care to keep a good Converſation; for as fire doth take off all droſs that is in a veſſel, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it; and as every thing that is ſlain, which he here calls a Sacrifice, gains a ſavour by Salt, and is preſerved from corruption, ſo let your Converſation be in all the World, like fire, which purifieth from ruſt, and like ſalt, which taketh away inſipidneſs, being in reſpect of your Converſation removed from ancient Cuſtoms, and a wicked Converſation; and as ſalt is good whil'ſt it remains in its own nature, ſo alſo is the Prieſthood whil'ſt it is preſerved in its purity, and a right Faith; and if this loſe its ſavour, the Faithful ceaſe in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Hope, becauſe the ſalt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prieſt hath not wherewith to ſalt, that is, to give a ſavour.</p>

He preſently explains the difficulty, and ſaith, <hi>For all they caſt in of their abundance.</hi> Chriſt here teacheth us two things. Firſt, That this gift which was made out of her penury, was more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and greater in God's eſteem, than that which proceeded from Redundancy. Secondly, That God doth not regard the greatneſs or ſmallneſs of a gift, but the will and mind wherewith it is given; and it is certain, That if it be given with a chearful will, it is accounted much and great with God, although it be ſmall; but if otherwiſe, it is meanly eſteemed by God, though much in quantity.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the Angels, neither the Son, but the Father.</hi> The Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Arrians,</hi> when they are deſirous to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the Son, they produce this Argument. To whom we anſwer, For, inaſmuch as he is God, he knew all things that are, before they were made; but inaſmuch as he was man, he ſaith, he knows not; and the very ſame that is God, is man, and no other, as he is life by nature, and became death for us, foraſmuch as he was man; ſo, though he doth know all things as being God, he ſaid, that he did not know as man: And as he was before <hi>Abraham</hi> in reſpect of his Godhead, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he ſaid, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was I am:</hi> yet he was after him, as being man; for if he had ſaid <hi>I know,</hi> he had been like to the Father onely, and not at all like unto us; but he ſaid, <hi>I know not,</hi> that he might be likened unto us, and that there might be no place left for miſtakes, or to ſay, that he was not made man; for this property of man, not to know things in futurity, was common to him, for he communicated in our want of knowledge, even as in other humane infirmities; and this is manifeſt from hence, that he did not ſay, <hi>Neither the Son of God knoweth,</hi> but neither the Son ſimply; as he was the Son of God, ſo was he a ſo the Son of man, and in that reſpect wanted knowledge, though he knew all things as God.</p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:105278:37"/>
                     <p>Moreover, it is certain, That as he was man, he ſaid he did not know, foraſmuch as he did not ſay concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Ghoſt that he did not know.</p>
                     <p>Again, we ſay, That God the Father is greater than the day of the coming of the Son, and is more hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and concealed than that day; and yet the Son ſaith, <hi>Even as the Father knoweth the Son, the Son know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Father.</hi> If therefore he knoweth the Father, who is high, and exalted above all things, and is more hidden and concealed than this day, how much more then doth he know this day? And if any one ſhall object, That the Father knows the Son perfectly, but that the Son knoweth the Father but in part, let him know, That for the ſame reaſon he might conclude, that the Father knoweth not the Son but in part; for the ſame knowledge is attributed to the Father and the Son, <hi>as the Father knoweth the Son,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>We ſay further, That if the Father knows this day and hour, the Son muſt neceſſarily know it, becauſe there is one knowledge of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit, for they are of one and the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſame will, the ſame power and operation, and therefore neceſſarily have they one and the ſame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, for that the Son created the Worlds, and Times, and Years, and Months, and Hours, and Dayes, it is manifeſt, That he knows the day and hour of his appearance; but if any one ſhall object, That he hath not yet created the day of his coming, he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the force of two reaſons.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>Firſt, From this which is written, <hi>That he finiſhed the heaven and the earth, and all that was in them, and God finiſhed his works on the ſeventh day.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:105278:37"/>
                        <item>Secondly, Let it be granted, That it were ſo, though it be not a Truth, yet he knew as God before hand thoſe Things which are not, and he knows every thing before hand.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Again, How doth he know the Prognoſtications and the Signs which are to be at the day of his coming, and yet not know the day? for he declareth how that there <hi>ſhall be lightning,</hi> and <hi>that the Sun ſhall be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and other ſuch like things; and <hi>the Stars ſhall fall from Heaven, and the powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken, and the ſign of the Son of man ſhall appear,</hi> and other the like things which are to happen in that day and hour; and how is it poſſible, That one ſhould know what things are in the Houſe, and not know the Houſe? or how doth a man know the thing that is within a City, or a Ship, without knowing the City or the Ship? And how can he who knoweth what things are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and within a Wall, ſay that he doth not know the Wall in the middle.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, as he knew the hour of his Birth, and the day of his firſt coming in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſo doth he know his ſecond coming.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt is the power and wiſdom of the Father;</hi> and in this that he ſaith <hi>the power,</hi> he ſheweth, That there is nothing out of his Juriſdiction and Providence; and by <hi>that of wiſdom,</hi> he declares, That there is nothing out of the reach of his knowledge, but that all things which are, and are to come, are comprehended within the compaſs of his knowledge; for if he can err in any thing, he is not perfect wiſdom, eſpecially ſince that he is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom of the Father, and in him is hidden all wiſdom, and he it is that gives wiſdom to the wiſe, as ſaith the Son of <hi>Syrach, All wiſdom is of the Lord, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105278:38"/>Chriſt is the Lord, whence it was that the Angels ſaid to the Shepherds, there is born unto you a Saviour, who is Chriſt the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Neither the Angels.</hi> In this which the Angels ſaid unto the Shepherds, <hi>viz. To you is born,</hi> &amp;c. which neither the Angels knew, did he forbid them to declare that day; and by this, <hi>That neither the Son</hi> (that is to ſay my ſelf) he ſtopt their mouths from ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; for in like manner, they asked him after the Reſurrection, <hi>Art thou at this time about to reſtore the Kingdom?</hi> And he ſtopt their mouths, ſaying, <hi>It doth not belong unto you to know the times and ſeaſons which the Father hath appointed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the Father.</hi> Inaſmuch as he ſpoke of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Father, he prevented them, that they might not ask him; and it is like to that of the mother of the ſons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> for being unwilling to anſwer whether he would grant the requeſt or no, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>It is not mine to give;</hi> when aſſuredly it was he who was to place the Sheep on his right hand, and the Goats on his left, and to call, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father;</hi> he did not anſwer, I will do it, that his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples who were there might not be offended, who yet were ſo much diſtaſted, that he ſpoke unto them, and pacified them, even as a Father having Sons, and they ask him for ſomewhat that is hidden, where he hath put it, and he being unwilling to let them know, ſaith, <hi>I know not;</hi> and wherefore did he not reveal it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not for their advantage, nor their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; for if he had declared it unto them, they had been careleſs and remiſs, and had not been diligently conſtant in prayer; and that this was ſo, is known from what he ſaid, <hi>Watch and pray.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:105278:38"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But of the day and hour.</hi> And it is neceſſary to know in the firſt place, That the Scriptures are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be taken according to the outward ſound of words; nor when they ſay, <hi>That God is a conſuming fire,</hi> are we to think, That he burns or flameth; nor that he is of Kin, or a Watchman, or corporeal, or compounded of differing Natures, or that he is ſubject to Paſſions, that he is angry, that he ſleeps or wakes, or is ſorrowful, or that he erred, or was ignorant; and according to that, <hi>He who is not born of water, and of the Spirit, ſhall not enter into the Kingdom;</hi> whereas many have been made famous for Martyrdom, who have not been baptized, <hi>the Thief alſo entred into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe:</hi> And no man can ſay, <hi>That Jeſus is Lord, but by the Spirit;</hi> yet the <hi>Manichees,</hi> the <hi>Mercionites,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Jewes,</hi> are well pleaſed with the word, and uſe it without the grace of the Spirit; and like it is to this, <hi>All of them have declined together, and are become reprobate, and all they who came were Thieves and Robbers:</hi> So alſo is this expreſſion, for if he did not know this day, and this hour, how was this ſaid, <hi>That I and my Father are one?</hi> for if in knowledge he be not one, wherein is he one? And if he did not know the day as well as the Father, how ſaid he, <hi>That all whatſoever the Father hath is mine?</hi> And if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath any thing which the Son knoweth not, how is it ſaid, <hi>That no man knows the Father, but the Son?</hi> And this is objected, and how do theſe agree? <hi>Is he one?</hi> and the Father knoweth nothing which the Son doth not know; and this, there is nothing high and exalted, but it is little in compariſon of other things; and thus ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>In him are hid all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom;</hi> and how, <hi>the Son, and neither the Son, but the Father.</hi> And if he knows the Father, it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105278:39"/>is certain that he knows him with all his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>Again, If he knows the Father, how doth he know the Father, and knows not this day? therefore this day is greater than the Father; and if the Father knows this day, of neceſſity alſo doth the Son know it; and if it be not ſo, the Father ſeems not to know; or elſe how much greater is the knowledge of this day, than the knowledge of the Father? And if he be maker of all things, how doth he not know his own Works? or is this day not reckoned amongſt his Works, nor in the number of the dayes of the year? And if ſo, let them ſhew what it is, or where it is; for every compleat day is made up of a day and night, and hours are the courſe of viciſſitudes; and an hour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of the Philoſophers, is not at all; for that which is paſt, is not, nor that which is to come, for it is not yet; and if he who had all things in his hand knoweth not the day, how did he create any thing which he knows not? how do theſe agree? And if the Spirit ſearcheth out every thing, even the profundities of God, and this is the Spirit of Chriſt, how is it that he doth not know thoſe things which were made by him? And how doth he know that the conſummation (of the World) ſhall be in the night? That two ſhall be in a Bed, and one ſhall be led away, and yet not know the day? for becauſe of the long interſpace of time, they thought that the end of the World was at hand, and that his appearance ſhould have been in their dayes, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid unto ſome, <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not, behold the day of the Lord cometh.</hi> He governs them as Children, for they had reapt no advantage from the knowledge of this day, nor the Generations after them, neither did he reveal the time of our death;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105278:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>and by this Declaration, he teacheth us, That if we be ask't by any one an unprofitable queſtion, we ſhould prudently ſhift it off, as it were, for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, leſt inſtead of a Fiſh, we ſhould hold forth to our Neighbours a Serpent.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, If theſe paſſages, <hi>viz. He knows not that day; I know ye not,</hi> as he ſaid unto the fooliſh (Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins) and <hi>I never knew ye,</hi> as he ſaid, ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood according to the outward ſound of words; many of the like are ſpoken of the Father, as this, <hi>God remembred Noah,</hi> as if he had recovered himſelf out of forgetfulneſs. Again, <hi>I will go down, and ſee whether they have acted and done according to the cry that hath aſcended up.</hi> And the like again, <hi>They did what I commanded them not, and it came not into my mind.</hi> And again, <hi>Adam where art thou? Where is Abel thy Brother?</hi> And if the Father, who is not cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with a Body, is attended with Attributes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, how much rather ſhould not he, who is cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with a Body for us, ſpeak after the manner of men, and as a Tree that is remote, and at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and unſeen, is known by the fruit which are preſented to view and brought nigh; ſo is our Lord made known by his ſigns, and by his Works, and by the Propheſies which have been made concerning him, and not by words which ſound of infirmity; and if he being cloathed with a Body, there were thoſe who denied that he was born of the Virgin, and ſaid that he was not begotten, but that he was a ſtranger, and that he appeared onely in fancy; how much the rather would they have ſaid ſo, had it not been for theſe Attributes of Infirmity.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, He did not reveal this day, becauſe it would not have advantaged them to have known it,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105278:40"/>and many would have been remiſs in the exerciſe of vertue until the laſt hour, but now foraſmuch as the coming to Judgment is concealed from us, we ſtand alvvayes in danger and fear.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, It ſeemed good unto God, that knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he ſhould not reveal it; and to man it vvas a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that he ſhould have done it; therefore foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he vvas deemed onely to be a man, it vvas not a matter of <hi>odium</hi> to conceal from them the day; but if any one had promiſed them who knew and would not have revealed it, he had been thought wicked and envious; and if he had revealed itit, had produced remiſneſs.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, This is to be taken notice of, That <hi>Mark</hi> onely ſaith, <hi>That neither the Son knoweth;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith no ſuch thing. <hi>Matthew,</hi> he wrote to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> They doubted of his <hi>Divinity;</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> of his <hi>Humanity,</hi> by reaſon of the ſeed of fancy which <hi>Simon</hi> had ſown amongſt them, <hi>viz. That our Lord had not aſſumed a Body,</hi> for which reaſon <hi>Mark</hi> adds, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Son,</hi> Teaching thereby, That he was not only God, but alſo man, <hi>who was like unto us in every thing, ſin excepted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After another Expoſition, thus: <hi>Mark</hi> doth not here call our Lord <hi>Son,</hi> but the faithful, who are called Sons by reaſon of Baptiſm; and Chriſt he calls <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> for he is the Father of the World to come; <hi>And my children, a little while I am with you, and behold I, and the children which the Lord hath given me;</hi> for the name Father, is uſed for the Father and the Son; for the Father, by Nature; for the Son, by Diſpenſation. And he uſed here a communion of name to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as this, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and I will raiſe it;</hi> whil'ſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105278:40"/>he ſpoke of his Body, the <hi>Jewes</hi> underſtood a Temple of ſtones. In like manner the Diſciples here, when they heard (theſe words) <hi>Neither the Angels, nor the Son, but the Father,</hi> they thought that he had called his own father <hi>Father,</hi> and himſelf <hi>Son;</hi> and they decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the queſtion, becauſe it was not of advantage to know; for if he ſpoke concerning the Father, <hi>he knows the day,</hi> this is not worthy admiration, for natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally he had this knowledge: but this deſerves admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, That the faithful ſhould gain a foreknowledge of any thing.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, As he being the power and life of all things, was exerciſed with infirmities, and ſlept, and was wearied, and was hungry; ſo here he is brought to that paſs, that he knows not the day. Becauſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were deſirous to know that which was too high for them, and that they might not be troubled, becauſe he did not reveal the myſtery unto them, he ſaith, <hi>That neither the Angels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take ye heed, watch and pray, for ye know not the day.</hi> He commanded them that they ſhould be vigilant, and watchful, for it is certain, That if they had known it, they had ſlept, and would not have watched; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he might drive forth ſloathfulneſs out of them, he doth not reveal the day; and foraſmuch as he ſaith, <hi>Pray,</hi> he ſheweth, That the power of Prayer is able to free (us) from the fear of this day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As a man taking a far journey.</hi> Even as a man ready to go to a remote place, calls his ſervants, and gives them power over his goods, promiſing to reward them plentifully who ſhall obſerve his commands, and to puniſh thoſe who ſhall ſlight his Word; if he ſhould alſo reveal unto them the day of his coming, one of theſe two things would happen: if the day of his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105278:41"/>coming vvere neer and ſhort, they vvould give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pleaſure, they vvould live vvantonly and idly, ſaying, <hi>The time is ſhort, and there is not ſpace ſufficient to fulfill his will;</hi> and neglectful men do altogether weaken and cut off hope: if the time of his coming were long, they would live pleaſantly and idly, and thoſe who are idle are neglectful, they would Wander and play the fool until the day came; for inaſmuch as he exhorts them to apply themſelves to their Work, concealing from them the day, they are incited on both ſides to the performance of his Will. It is thus to be explained after another manner, Even as a man the Maſter of a Family being about to take a Journey, if he acquaint his ſervants with the day of his return, from the day of his ſetting forth, the fear of him is taken from them, and they eat and drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſay, our Maſter deferreth his coming, for he appointed ſuch a day for his return; but if he do not appoint a day for his coming, they remain in fear and terror, thinking with themſelves, perhaps he may come in an hour we know not of, and may take us in our follies: So alſo Chriſt did not reveal that day unto us, nor the time of our death, that we might be retained in awe, and be careful and watchful.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the Maſter who took the Journey, and declared the day of his coming to his ſervants, was bound up within reſtriction and limits, and could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anticipate nor prolong the time, according to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; for if he come before the time appointed, and they do not come forth to meet him, it is not juſt, that he ſhould reprehend them, becauſe the day appointed is not yet come; and if he prolongs the time, when he cometh, the ſame thing hapneth: So our Lord alſo, had he revealed this day, they had been like Lords, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105278:41"/>he as a ſervant, ſo that he could not have prevented nor delayed the time; for if he had done the one or the other, one of the two had hapned, either they had ſaid that becauſe the day of his coming was not known before, it fell out ſo, or that there was a cogent Maſter above him, who conſtrain'd him to anticipate, or go beyond the time appointed; for as much therefore as he did not reveal the time, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the power of his dominion; and foraſmuch as he excited their diligence <hi>to watch and pray,</hi> he kept them in fear, and expelled careleſneſs out of them. Again, as he gave men to underſtand that they were mortal, that therefore they might be kept in awe, and practiſe Holineſs, but did not declare unto them on what day they ſhould dye, leſt they might ſin upon the opinion that their life was to laſt longer; ſo here, he did not reveal to his Apoſtles the day of his coming, to the end they might be watchful and diligent in prayer.</p>

                        <hi>Who dippeth with me in the diſh.</hi> There were two round Tables ſet before them, and <hi>Judas</hi> ſate down at
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105278:42"/>our Lords Table. Others ſay, That there was but one round Table, and all of them ſate down to it; but that there were two Diſhes at the Table, and <hi>Judas</hi> dipped into that which was our Lords.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And he took with him Peter, and James, and John.</hi> Theſe three he took with him when he prayed here; he took them alſo with him when he raiſed to life the Damſel, and when he was Transfigured in the Mount; not that he undervalued the reſt: but, firſt of all, for the great love which they bore unto him; ſecondly, becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> was not vvorthy of that ſight; thirdly, for a Teſtimony of vvhat he did, for the Teſtimony of Three is ſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And he went a little nearer, and fell upon the earth. John</hi> expreſſeth this exactly, He departed from them about a ſtones caſt; he did not pray before them, that he might not be thought proud or vain-glorious, and that he might Teach them to pray privately: nor did he depart to a great diſtance, that they might hear the words of his prayer what they were, and might learn by that pattern.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But not my will.</hi> He doth not ſay ſo, as if his Will were contrary to the Will of his Father; but by way of ſubmiſſion, he uſed this expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, He did it for inſtruction to others, that we ſhould not be troubled for thoſe Things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us from enemies; which oftentimes hapneth not from our Will, but from the infirmity of Nature; for he was pleaſed to Teach this to all men in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, That what paſſions we ſuffer by reaſon of thoſe who vex us, is not blameable, by reaſon of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Nature; yet ought we to take a care, if we be not cleared of them by the love of God, that we ſhun natural commotions.</p>

Judas,</hi> becauſe it was night, leſt as they went, they might take another, and leave our Lord, he gave this ſign unto them, <hi>Whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I ſhall kiſs, take.</hi> And, it is probable, That it was uſual with our Lord, to kiſs any of the Diſciples when they came from a remote place.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And they led him to Gogulta.</hi> It is called <hi>Gogulta,</hi> by reaſon of its roundneſs.</p>

                        <hi>And they gave him to drink wine mixed with myrrhe.</hi> That is to ſay, That he might be Tranſported beyond the uſe of Reaſon, and Intoxicated, and might not be ſenſible of what they were to do unto him; but he did not drink it for two Reaſons.</p>

                        <hi>And he received it not.</hi> That is to ſay, He drank it not. Once they gave him Vinegar, and another time Wine mixed with Myrrhe, that they might add <hi>aſperity</hi> and <hi>bitterneſs</hi> to his Paſſion; and that, as a Token of the exceeding-great Hatred towards him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments.</hi> In <hi>Matthew</hi> we have expounded theſe Things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What every man ſhould have.</hi> That is to ſay, To which of them ſuch a part ſhould fall, and which of the Souldiers was to take ſuch a part; his Under-Coat was glorious, having never a ſeam from the upper ſide; and they did not divide it, but put a price thereupon, and divided the price into four parts, and then they caſt lots amongſt themſelves, and agreed, That he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the lot fell, ſhould have the Coat, and pay the other three parts of the price to his Comrades, and this is that which <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, <hi>What every man ſhould have.</hi> That is to ſay, what every one of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould have, whether the Coat, or part of the price.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the occaſion of his death was written.</hi> That is to ſay, That he was Crucified, becauſe he deſigned to uſurp the Kingdom.</p>

                        <hi>And with him they crucified two thieves.</hi> Firſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was found guilty of Rebellion againſt God and the King, as they were.

                     <p>
                        <hi>And one ran and filled a ſponge with vinegar.</hi> That is to ſay, inſtead of Wine, they gave him Vinegar; that they might dry his Tongue, ſo that he might not cry any more.</p>

In like manner, there was a Family or Tribe in the land of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and it was highly honoured; and if there were not any to be found of the Progeny of Kings, they ſet up Kings out of that Tribe; and when any of them Tranſgreſſed, they whipped his Horſe inſtead of him, with white handgripes of Wooll: Amongſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> alſo was a Tribe called <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Gondi namiran;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Immortal Tribe.</hi> And it was not lawful to inſtruct or correct them when they offended.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He was confident, and went in unto Pilate.</hi> That is to ſay, That he durſt ask him who was Crucified as a Rebel againſt the Kingdom, and was reputed as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God.</p>
                     <p>Again, It was a bold Act, becauſe he knew that he was to be accounted an Enemy to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> for honouring the body of our Lord; he was confident: That is to ſay, becauſe it was a Feſtival, and the Law did not permit it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And Pilate marvailed if he were already dead.</hi> He marvailed, becauſe he thought the time of his death was not yet come. At the Third hour he was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and at the Ninth hour he dyed; and from the Third, to the Ninth, are but ſix hours: for it was thought, that one who had been Crucified but ſix hours, would not have dyed; and when he heard that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105278:44"/>he was dead, he wondred. And this Teſtifieth for Chriſt, That he dyed of his own Will, and not by conſtraint; for that he dyed truly as to his Body, we ſay, but, that he admitted death of his own Will, and not by conſtraint as we; the Thieves were not dead: but he becauſe of his own accord he permitted death to approach unto him, therefore he dyed at the Ninth hour.</p>
                     <p>Again, He marvailed as at ſomething that was not cuſtomary; for every one that is Crucified remains a day or two, but he failed in the Ninth hour of the day, and whatſoever was done there, was a miracle.</p>

And he calls him <hi>Peter,</hi> to ſhew the ſtrength of his love, though he was ſomewhat lyable to humane fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that he was reſtored by Repentance to his former Honour, ſo as to be the foundation of the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And in the morning, the firſt day of the week, he aroſe and appeared.</hi> In the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy, and the <hi>Harkalian,</hi> it is thus written: <hi>When he aroſe in the morning of the firſt of the week, he appeared firſt of all to</hi> Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene. This ſenſe is apt, and it is apparent, That firſt he ſaid <hi>when he aroſe,</hi> and then made a diſtinction, by interpoſing a point, and afterwards added the other words, <hi>viz. in the morning of the firſt of the week, he appeared to</hi> Mary Magdalene. Whence we underſtand, That our Saviour firſt aroſe at a time unknown to any but the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, for no Creature knew it; for if we do not know our own Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at what hour or time it ſhall be, ſo no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at what time Chriſt aroſe. That he aroſe truly, we know; but at what time or hour of the night, we know not: but whil'ſt it was <hi>the time of the morning of the firſt of the week, he appeared to</hi> Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene, as <hi>John</hi> hath ſaid, and written.</p>
                     <p>Again, The words <hi>morning,</hi> and <hi>appeared,</hi> are annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Mary,</hi> and not to the time <hi>when he aroſe;</hi> yet here the word <hi>aroſe</hi> is interpoſed, though in congruity of ſenſe, it goes before the word <hi>morning,</hi> becauſe he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105278:45"/>ſpoke briefly of the Reſurrection; and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he appeared to <hi>Mary,</hi> he rendred the ſenſe confuſed.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Severus</hi> ſaith, That there are many Copies of the Goſpel of <hi>Mark,</hi> which want from the <hi>morning of the firſt day of the week he aroſe,</hi> unto the end of the Book; ſo that the Goſpel ends with theſe words, <hi>Neither ſaid they any thing to any man, for they were afraid.</hi>

                        <hi>Afterwards he appeared to the eleven.</hi> That is to ſay, He laid before them their want of Faith, and hardneſs of Heart, ſaying, <hi>That they did not give credit unto them who had ſeen that he was riſen.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>He that believeth.</hi> He ſheweth, That firſt a man gets Faith, and then worketh Miracles; according to this, <hi>If ye have Faith, ye ſhall remove Mountains.</hi> As theſe ſigns have been wrought amongſt them; ſo if Faith ſhall be found in them, they ſhall work Miracles, according to what is ſaid, <hi>He who hath Faith, can do every thing.</hi>

                     <p>Again, He calls him a <hi>Mourner,</hi> who being free from ſin, mourns for the evil of other men, as <hi>Samuel</hi> for that of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Sadneſs hath ſeized on me for the ſins of thoſe who have left thy Law:</hi> Or when we compute the Happineſs from which <hi>Adam</hi> fell, or the Infelicity wherein we are left, according as it was ſaid of one of the Saints, <hi>That whenſoever he was willing to eat, did weep;</hi> and when he was asked the Reaſon, anſwered, <hi>I remember what we were in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and how low we are caſt to eat the graſs, as the Beaſts:</hi> Theſe therefore are Mourners, who mourn for their ſins.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>We ſay, That they ſaid ſo concerning the natural and hidden Viſion of God; for the Nature of God, ſuch as it is, perſonally tranſcends the comprehenſion of humane underſtandings, and therefore they ſaid, <hi>That he is neither ſeen nor comprehended.</hi> Therefore this, <hi>That they ſhall ſee God,</hi> hath this meaning, That he who is pure in heart, participateth of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and gaineth life uncorruptible, and a Kingdom for joy without ceaſing; and the light of Truth are called the Viſion of God, therefore he calleth <hi>Viſion</hi> a <hi>Communion,</hi> according to that, <hi>The wicked ſhall be taken away, and ſhall not ſee glory</hi> (which is) That they ſhall not participate of Glory.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, <hi>God created us after his Image,</hi> as the Wax according to the likeneſs of the Seal wherewith
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105278:52"/>it is impreſſed, and breareth its Effigies; but we by our wickedneſs have covered it, as Ruſt obſcureth Iron; for he whoſe heart is pure from Paſſions, ſeeth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the image of Divine nature, as Iron, when it is poliſhed from its droſs, yieldeth ſplendor and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, eſpecially if it be brought to a clear Sun ſhine: Let us therefore be pure in heart, that we may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the bleſſing, and be comforted in the Viſion of the Divine image.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Viſion</hi> is taken in ſeven ſeveral ſignifications, but generally it may be reduced into three <hi>(viz.)</hi> to <hi>Senſe, Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> and God is onely ſeen by Faith, and Faith is the perſuaſion of thoſe things which are in Hope.</p>
                     <p>Again, He is ſeen in his Works, according to that, <hi>They ſhall ſeek after God, and find him out in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> The Organ of this ſight is a pure Heart, which doth not adhere to earthly Things.</p>

                           <hi>AND he went and hanged himſelf. Luke</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> doth not ſay, That he hanged himſelf, but that he burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his bowels guſhed out; and it might have been, that after he was hanged, he burſt aſunder.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>famous priſoner called Baraba.</hi> His name was Jeſus; and that no errour might ariſe from the Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of name, he was named from his Father.</p>

                           <hi>Scourged Jeſus with whips.</hi> Cords that were pleated, for it was the cuſtom of the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſcourge him firſt whom they would crucifie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>They plated a Crown of Boughs.</hi> That is to ſay, of Thorn, having white bloſſoms.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>They came to a place which was called</hi> Golgotha. They ſay, That <hi>Shem</hi> the ſon of <hi>Noah</hi> did there bury
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105278:80"/>the head of <hi>Adam,</hi> and this was the Court of <hi>Aran</hi> the <hi>Jebuſite.</hi>

                           <hi>And they gave him to drink vineger.</hi> In ſome of the Greek copies it is written Wine.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The cauſe of his death in writing.</hi> In the Greek it is, <hi>His accuſation which was written. Luke</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>That they wrote in three Languages, in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.</hi> The reaſon was, that theſe three Nations were then celebrated in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> more than the <hi>Syrians</hi> and the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and the reſt, which much leſs eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And they crucified with him two Thieves.</hi> He who was on his right hand had the name of <hi>Titus,</hi> and he on the left hand was named <hi>Domcus,</hi> for ſo it is to be found in the Book of St. <hi>Aretus,</hi> the Diſciple of <hi>Paul.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Alſo the Thieves who were crucified with him, reviled him.</hi> It is probable, that both of them did at firſt blaſpheme; but afterwards, he on the right hand, when he ſaw the darkneſs which hapned, took it into conſideration, and confeſſed; and the other, though he ſaw what hapned, did not conſider it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And there was darkneſs over the whole earth.</hi> This darkneſs was not only upon the Land of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but it was alſo obſerved to extend unto <hi>Athens,</hi> as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite</hi> declares in his Diſcourſe againſt <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponis</hi> the Sophiſter; and this was an Eclipſe of the Sun, not by the Moon, as are all natural Eclipſes thereof; but it was contrary to cuſtom by the body of ſome thick cloud, or ſome other thing, which by Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence aroſe in the face of the Sun, and darkned it; and it is demonſt able from hence, That it was not in the Newneſs of the Moon, but about the full Moon, <hi>to wit,</hi> on the 14th day thereof.</p>

Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> do not ſet forth at what hour our Lord was crucified, but <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, it was the Third hour when they crucified him. And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, it was about the Sixth hour when <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> ſate upon the Tribunal, and ſaid unto the <hi>Jewes, Shall I Crucifie your King?</hi> And ſome, deſirous to ſhew the Truth of both ſayings, ſay, That <hi>Pilate</hi> ſate in Judgment upon our Lord from the Third hour to the Sixth, and at the Sixth hour delivered him up to be crucified, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith. But <hi>Mark,</hi> foraſmuch as from the Third hour wherein they began to judge him, they were reſolved in their minds to crucifie him, he ſaid, That they crucified him the Third hour. And we ſay, That this might have been probable, if before the compelling of <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and the coming to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and the drinking of imbittered Wine, and the dividing of his garments, <hi>Mark</hi> had ſaid this, That it was about the Third hour when they crucified him: But behold it was not ſo. Others ſay, That this in St. <hi>John</hi> is an errour, not of the Evangeliſt (God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) but of the firſt Scribe, who, inſtead of Three which he would have written, wrote Six. But without undervaluing the inſufficiency of theſe two Anſwers, I ſay, That <hi>Mark</hi> reckoned from the hours which were from the beginning of the day, until the hour wherein our Lord was crucified, and they were three; but <hi>John</hi> computeth the hour from the time when the Jewiſh Sergeants apprehended our Lord, and bound him at night before the Cock crowed, until the hour wherein they crucified him, and it was the ſixth hour, three of the night of the preparation, and three of the day.</p>

                        <p>THat Baptiſm was the Beginning of the Goſpel, according to the order ſet down by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> is evident from this, That before our Lord was Baptized, he neither Preached, nor Evangelized; but after that he was Baptized, and Tempted, he began to ſay, <hi>Repent, the Kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> And St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> ſaith, That this <hi>Mark</hi> firſt uſed the word <hi>Evangelium,</hi> and this is clear from hence, That the other Three Evangeliſts made no mention thereof.</p>

                  <p>SInce that the wonderful Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of our Saviour into Heaven, have been taken notice of by many; and for that it hath been the ancient cuſtom of Nations to ſignifie new Occurrences unto thoſe who are chief in Authority, leſt they ſhould remain ignorant of any thing which happened, therefore it is, That <hi>Pilate</hi> hath communicated unto King <hi>Tiberius</hi> thoſe things which have been publiſh't concerning the Reſurrection of our Saviour from the dead through all <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> with the addition of ſome portentous things which he heard concerning him; and how that after he aroſe from the dead, he was by many believed to be God. It is ſaid, That <hi>Tiberius</hi> referr'd this matter to the Senate, and that the Senate rejected the ſame, becauſe they had not firſt approved of it, for according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtom, No man could obtain Divine honour, but by the Sentence and Deeree of the Senate; and that was done truly for this cauſe, for that the ſalutary Doctrine of the Goſpel had no need of humane appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or commendation: But this matter concerning our Seviour being rejected by the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, after it was referred unto them, <hi>Tiberius</hi> keeping his former

                  <p>Moreover, He ſheweth that Blaſphemy againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is of a lower degree, but Blaſphemy againſt the Spirit is great and difficult. There might be ſome excuſe for Blaſphemy againſt him, becauſe they ſaw him veſted with a body, and he appeared to be a man; but the proof of the Spirit they took from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the Prophets, who ſpoke concerning him, and therefore they were inexcuſable; and according to what I ſaid, ye are offended with me, becauſe I am cloathed with fleſh: but foraſmuch as ye have not ſeen the Spirit ſo cloathed, but working miracles, wherefore do ye blaſpheme againſt him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither in this World, nor in that which is to come.</hi> For ſome men are Tormented here and there, as the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> and the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who were Tormented here in the Captivity, and in the other World, becauſe they did not believe; and there are others who are neither Tormented here nor there, as the Apoſtles, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and <hi>Job:</hi> for although they ſuffered afflictions, yet whatſoever they endured, was not a puniſhment,

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105278:107"/>of a Reſurrection, they bent their endeavours onely for the acquiſition of things appertaining to this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> had a Daughter by <hi>Herodias,</hi> who was alſo called <hi>Herodias,</hi> after her mothers name; for which reaſon, <hi>John</hi> prohibited him to accompany with his Brothers wife.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Herod</hi> was not of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> wherefore then did <hi>John</hi> reprove him? Becauſe his Father, himſelf, and his Brethren, made ſhew, as if they would be reputed <hi>Jewes,</hi> and that they would be ſubject to the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſephus</hi> the Writer ſaith, That in the life time of his Brother he was ſo infatuated, as to commit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with her, and that he ſeparated her from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whil'ſt he was alive; and he injured his Wife the Daughter of <hi>Arethas</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> His Father in-law made War againſt him, becauſe he contemned his Daughter, and made a Strumpet of his Daughter in-law; and it was by reaſon of her, that <hi>Herod</hi> loſt his Kingdom, and was with her caſt into Priſon in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany</hi> a Town of <hi>Galilee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others ſay, That after the death of his Brother, he committed Fornication with her.</p>
                  <p>Others, That in the life time of his Brother, he committed Folly with her, wherefore, and not for that ſhe had a Daughter, he forbade him to take her, for a Female was not called Seed, nor did the Law prohibit a man to take the Wife of his Brother after his death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is not lawful for thee to take her.</hi> The Law in the Old Teſtament commanded to take the Wife of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Brother, and this <hi>John</hi> was a Preacher of the New Teſtament, and therefore he forbade <hi>Herod.</hi>

                  <p>Others ſay, That the Prohibition proceeded from hence, that <hi>Herodias</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> conſpir'd together, and cauſed <hi>Philip</hi> to be put to death. It's true, a Brother had power to take the Wife of a deceaſed Brother; but if he dyed having Sons, the Law did not permit his Brother to take his Wife, but a ſtranger, and this was to the end that Kindred of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> might be kept among themſelves, and multiplied, foraſmuch as they wanted hope of the Reſurrection, and a ſtranger was not to raiſe ſeed <hi>(i. e.)</hi> an heir.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſaid, let there not be fruit on thee for ever.</hi> Some ſay, That he curſt the Fig-tree, becauſe it was a figure of the Law which had no fruit to offer unto Chriſt. Others, becauſe it was a figure of the multitude: But we ſay, That there was fruit in the Law, and in the multitude, though not much; for behold, there were Twelve Apoſtles, and Seventy two Evangeliſts, beſides <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who believed in our Lord, who were all the fruit of the Law, and of the multitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But he dryed up the Fig-tree.</hi> Firſt of all in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Diſciples, that they might underſtand that he was not deſtitute of power, but ſuffer'd of his own accord.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, In reſpect of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that he might put them to ſhame; for if he had deſir'd it in the time of his Paſſion, he might as well have dryed up them as the Fig-tree, he therefore curs't it (as we ſaid) that there ſhould be no opinion taken up of his weakneſs as if he had dyed unwillingly, for the time of his Paſſion drawing near, it was neceſſary that he ſhould ſhew his power to his Diſciples and Crucifiers, yet he did not exerciſe the ſame upon men, becauſe he was a lover of Mankind; and if he had ſhewn his power upon a man, it would have been thought that he had been dryed up by reaſon of his ſins, and not by the power of his acting; he ſhewed his power upon that which was another mans poſſeſſion, and it is from poſſeſſions or riches that an honourable life is aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with temporal eſteem, but by a Tree, and from that Tree, which is of all other Trees moſt ſoft and moiſt, inſomuch that when it is cut down, it doth ſcarce wither in a long time; and in that he dryed it up by a word of his mouth, he did ſhew unto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Crucifiers his power, and that he ſuffered vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily. The Tree which <hi>Adam</hi> did eat of, was a Fig-tree, and therein was a retribution of Juſtice.

                     <hi>i.e. Come thou even unto me,</hi> becauſe the Fig-tree was the Tree whereof they eat, and therefore our Lord caus'd it to wither, for that it had ſeduced <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi>

                  <p>Others ſay, That when the multitude cut down Branches from the Trees, and caſt them in the way, the Owner of the Fig-tree did not permit them to cut thereof, and therefore he caus'd it to wither.</p>
                  <p>Others ſay, Becauſe the <hi>Gadarens</hi> did not come to our Lord, he drowned their Swine, that they might come forth to him againſt their wills; ſo the Lord of the Fig-tree determined in his mind, that he wou'd not come forth to Chriſt, and therefore he cauſed the Fig tree to wither, that he might come forth againſt his will.</p>
                  <p>Others ſay, That when our Lord ſaid, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and the third day,</hi> &amp;c.

And that it might be known that he who was the Creator of all things was Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore the Creatures loſt their light; and that the Propheſie of <hi>Zachary</hi> might be fulfilled, <hi>The Sun ſhall be darkned at Noon-day.</hi> Concerning the Eclipſe of the Sun, it is moſt true, That on the Thirtieth of the Moon the Sun groweth dark on the day when they<note n="*" place="margin">New Moon.</note> both come under the ſame ſign of the Zodiack; and although it comes to paſs that the Sun and Moon be Eclipſed twice a year, yet is the Sun but for a ſmaller ſpace Eclipſed; nor is it darkned, but ſeems onely to us as if it were darkned, it being undeprivable of light; nor is it everywhere diſcernable that it is Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſed, but in certain places, and chiefly at the<note n="*" place="margin">Perhaps he means the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of <hi>19</hi> years.</note> length of years: for when the Sun cometh to one of the Circles which are called the <hi>darkning Limits,</hi> and is placed directly behind the Moon as to the Circle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Ecliptick, the Moon then being under the Sun, it is ſaid to be obſcured; but when the Moon is Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſed,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105278:111"/>the cauſe thereof is, that it is placed in the Circle <hi>(viz.) the darkning Limit,</hi> and the ſhadow of the earth <hi>(viz.)</hi> the extenſion thereof doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the light of the Sun to ſhine on that place of the Circle where the Moon takes its courſe at that time, and it is obſcured on the ſudden, and having paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that place, it again borroweth light of the Sun; but in the time of Crucifying our Lord, the contrary happened in matter of Fact, for the Moon was not onely not in conjunction with the Sun, but alſo remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therefrom the ſpace of the Hemiſphere, which was the meaſure of the Suns courſe which it runs in One hundred and eighty days, and Sixty five minutes, and Fifteen degrees <hi>(i. e.)</hi> dayes, and half of the Circle, and this was declarative of the Majeſty of him who was Crucified; and becauſe the Lord of Lights was hung upon the Croſs, therefore they fail'd, and this darkneſs hath three properties differing from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural computation:
<list>
                        <item>Firſt, That it was in the Full of the Moon.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, That it laſted the ſpace of Three hours.</item>
                        <item>Thirdly, That it prevailed over all the earth. And all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Caldean</hi> Philoſophers who were in <hi>Caldea</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> wrote, <hi>That one of the Trinity ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered that day.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list> And this agreeth with what <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Kings of the earth aroſe (i.e.)</hi> from their Thrones, <hi>and wondered at the ſign that hapned:</hi> For this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was like to that in the beginning of the Creation, all the earth did put on mourning for its Lord, the Sun being cloathed with Cypreſs, and the Moon grew red, and became as blood; and though it were not the time of her * birth, it ſuddenly appeared in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and ran impetuouſly to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and aſſociated her ſelf with the Sun, and they both ſate in mourning, as good ſervants that are afflicted for the evil which befalls

Moreover, it is evident, That the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when Chriſt was Crucified, was not an Eclipſe; and it's evident from theſe demonſtrations, An Eclipſe doth not continue Three hours, but this was a darkneſs of Three hours. Moreover, An Eclipſe is not over all the earth, but this darkneſs was over all places of the earth; and a Solary Eclipſe happeneth on the Thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth day of the Moon, but this darkneſs was on the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the Moon, when the Sun was removed from the Moon half its courſe <hi>(i. e.)</hi> One hundred and eighty dayes [of the Suns motion] and ſtood in the midſt of the Sphere of the Firmament. Concerning the Eclipſe of the Sun, and of the Moon, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſe of their effects, we have ſpoken at large in the Book of our Epiſtle in the Tract concerning Faith, and the nature of things intellectual and ſenſitive, which is called a Book of the Doubts which I have made.</p>

                     <hi>HE ſhall be great.</hi> In other Copies, <hi>And he ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> The Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſay, <hi>That afterward he was to be great.</hi> Againſt whom we ſay, That he was not newly called the Son of the moſt High, nor was he magnified; but he was naturally Great, and this which was ſaid, <hi>That he ſhall be,</hi> and <hi>ſhall be called,</hi> ſignifieth, That he was to be revealed, and made known, for thoſe things which were to be when they were not, differ from ſuch things as had a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105278:112"/>being, and were concealed, but afterwards were to be revealed. And this word <hi>Great,</hi> ſignifieth as much as that he had Majeſty, and that it was to be revealed, according to that, <hi>I have made known thy Name to the ſons of men;</hi> not that he had not been, but that he was from Eternity; and not that the Father had not been truly, or that he was not called Father, did he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt him unto men eternally, but that he was eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally a Father, and was hidden. By this then that <hi>I have made known,</hi> he ſaith, as much as <hi>I have revealed unto them thy Name;</hi> and this is like unto that which is written in <hi>Iſaiah, That he ſhall be called the Lord of all the earth,</hi> not as if he had not been Lord from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                  <p>And if they ſay that he was newly call'd, this will convince them that he is the power of the Higheſt, and the power of the Higheſt is more intimate, and of more affinity with the Father, than this, <hi>That he is the Son of the Higheſt,</hi> for many are call'd the ſons of the moſt High, according to that, <hi>Ye are all the ſons of him who is on High,</hi> but theſe are never call'd the power of the moſt High. Again, we ſay, That whatſoever is the Father, the Son is alſo; and whatſoever the Father hath, the Son hath, except the peculiar proprieties <hi>(viz.)</hi> the perſonal indications <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that the Father is the cauſe, and the begetter of the Son, and the Son is the effect, and that which is begotten of him, and whatſoever is the Fathers, is the Sons alſo, except pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; therefore as the Father hath naturally ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and goodneſs, and the Godhead, and Life, and Majeſty, ſo the Son hath, for he is his natural Son; but becauſe he was conceived, and was made man in the fleſh, it hath been ſaid concerning him, <hi>That he ſhall be great;</hi> and this was his Exinanition in Truth, That
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:105278:112"/>what he was naturally, was ſaid that he was to be, and that he was called ſo, and aſſumed it, and this, <hi>That he ſhall be glad,</hi> is like to this, <hi>That he was,</hi> according to this, <hi>Of her was born Jeſus, who is called Chriſt.</hi> Here theſe words, <hi>That he ſhall be called,</hi> are ſynonymous with to the words, <hi>That he is,</hi> and <hi>every one that teacheth, ſhall be called Rabbi,</hi> and <hi>every one who ſhall break one of the Commandments, ſhall be called leaſt;</hi> for as theſe things were called ſo, ſo they were indeed.</p>

                     <hi>THere went out a command from Auguſtus Caeſar. Auguſtus</hi> was the proper name of this King, but the name <hi>Caeſar</hi> was a common name; for every King who was ſet over the <hi>Romans</hi> was called <hi>Caeſar,</hi> even unto this, as the King of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> was called <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and of the <hi>Perſians Koſro,</hi> and this <hi>Caeſar</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> The Command went out, That the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited World ſhould be Taxed, becauſe he was deſirous to know the number of men within his Juriſdiction, according as <hi>David</hi> ſent <hi>Joab,</hi> and numbred the people. Others ſay, becauſe he was willing to ſend every one into his own City and Countrey; but theſe opinions are not the likelieſt to be true, but that which is moſt probable, is, That he was willing to raiſe Pole-money, which is manifeſt from that which <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſaid in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles, That</hi> Judah <hi>of</hi> Galilee <hi>aroſe in the dayes when men were taxed for Pole-money, and there was not another tax neither before nor after that.</hi> And St. <hi>Ephraim</hi> in his Expoſition teſtifieth as much, and Chriſt was born in the time of this Tax, and he excited this King thereunto, though he were unworthy, as he did

Auguſtus</hi> is expounded an ariſing, brightneſs and ſplendor, and Chriſt is the ſplendor of the Father, and did ariſe from on high. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had not yet governed Sixteen years, and Chriſt unto whom he was Type, hath no end of his Kingdom. And if <hi>Caeſar</hi> Taxed them for Pole-money, Chriſt alſo ſaid, <hi>Give unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>that which is Caeſars.</hi> And if it were to know how many men were within the compaſs of his Juriſdiction, Chriſt alſo, in regard of the Providence he hath over us, ſaid, <hi>The hairs of your heads are numbred;</hi> and if it were for the return of every one into his own Countrey or Region, Chriſt alſo brought forth Souls out of Hell, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to return unto their former place.</p>

                  <p>WE profeſs and believe with a ſincere heart, God the Father, not made nor begotten, and without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Begetter of the Son, and Fountain of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>We believe God the Word, not made but begotten, and having a beginning from the Father before the world, being not after nor younger than the Father; the Father being Father onely, and the Son Son onely.</p>
                  <p>We believe the Holy Ghoſt not made, eternal, not begotten, but proceeding, coeſſential with the Father, and equal in glory with the Son.</p>
                  <p>We believe the Holy Trinity, One Nature, One Godhead, not Three Gods but One God, One Will, One Kingdom, One Authority, Creator of all things viſible and inviſible.</p>
                  <p>We believe the Holy Church, the remiſſion of ſins, the communion of Saints.</p>
                  <p>We believe that One of the Three Perſons, the Word God, begotten of the Father before the world, deſcending in time, took of the blood of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of God, and united it unto his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; was Nine moneths contain'd in the Womb of an uncorrupted Virgin, and that he was perfect God, and perfect man, with ſoul, mind, and body; One Soul, and One Perſon, compos'd in One Subſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>God was made Man without mutation, without
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105278:115"/>confuſion, without ſeed of Conception, of incorrupt Nativity. There is no beginning of his Divinity, nor end of his Humanity; for Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</p>
                  <p>We believe our Lord Jeſus Chriſt convers'd on earth; and that after Thirty Years converſation here, He was Baptized, the Father teſtifying, <hi>This is my well-beloved Son,</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt deſcending as a Dove. That He was tempted of Satan, and that he aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preached Salvation unto men. That He laboured in Body, and ſuffered in wearineſs. That he was hungry and thirſty. That He afterward voluntarily came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his enemies. That he was Crucified, and Dyed in his Body, but lived in the <hi>Divinity:</hi> He preached unto ſouls, and took Hell captive, and free'd the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. After Three dayes he aroſe from the Dead, and appeared to the Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>I believe our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is with the ſelf ſame Body aſcended into Heaven, and that he ſits on the Right Hand of the Father. Moreover, That He is with the ſame Body, and with the glory of the Father, to judge the living and the dead at the Reſurrection of all men. I believe alſo a retribution of Works, eternal life for the Juſt, and eternal torment for Sinners.</p>
